# Assignment 2

## Question 2

Since $n=30$, you can use either the Gaussian or Student' t distribution.

Find a critical Z value, from a Gaussian distribution, given a type I error rate $\alpha = 0.05$:

```{r}
alpha <- 0.05
Z_alpha_half <- qnorm(1 - alpha/2)
Z_alpha_half
```

Find a critical T value, from a Student' t distribution, given a type I error rate $\alpha = 0.05$ and degree of freedom $\nu = 16$:

```{r}
alpha <- 0.05
nu <- 16
T_critical <- qt(1 - alpha/2, nu)
T_critical
```

## Question 5

Given code in assignment template (swimmer data).

```{r}
df<-data.frame(s1 = c(59.62,59.74,59.48,59.43,59.65,59.72,59.50,59.63,60.01,59.68),s2 = c(59.81,59.41,59.32,59.63,59.76,59.50,59.64,59.83,59.86,59.51))

kable(df,col.names=c("Swimmer 1","Swimmer 2"),booktabs = TRUE, linesep = "") %>%
  kable_styling(position = "center",full_width = FALSE)
```

Find the mean, standard deviation and variance of the two swimmers.

```{r}
df %>% summarise_all(.funs = list(mean = ~mean(.), sd = ~sd(.), var = ~var(.)))
```

**Only use the following two snippets if needed for paired difference**:

```{r}
diff <- data.frame(Difference = df$s2 - df$s1)
kable(diff,booktabs = FALSE,linesep="") %>%
  kable_styling(position = "center", full_width = FALSE)
```

Find the mean and standard deviation of the difference:

```{r}
diff %>% summarise_at("Difference", .funs = list(mean = ~mean(.), sd = ~sd(.)))
```

## Question 6

Given code in assignment template (experiment data).

```{r}
df<-data.frame(Person = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7),Before = c(4,5,5,4,3,6,2),After = c(7,8,3,5,4,5,5))
kable(df,booktabs = FALSE,linesep="") %>%
  kable_styling(position = "center", full_width = FALSE)
```

Find mean, standard deviation and variance before and after the experiment:
```{r}
df %>% summarise_at(c("Before", "After"), .funs = list(mean = ~mean(.), sd = ~sd(.), var = ~var(.)))
```

**Only use the following two snippets if needed for paired difference**:

Find the difference between after and before the experiment:

```{r}
diff <- data.frame(Person = df$Person, Difference = df$After - df$Before)
kable(diff,booktabs = FALSE,linesep="") %>%
  kable_styling(position = "center", full_width = FALSE)
```

Find the mean and standard deviation of the difference:

```{r}
diff %>% summarise_at("Difference", .funs = list(mean = ~mean(.), sd = ~sd(.)))
```

# Assignment 1

Load the `episodes` data set.

```{r}
data(episodes)
```

## Part 1: Summarising Data

### Question 1

Shows the IMDB rankings for each series of *Star Trek*.

```{r}
ggplot(episodes, aes(x = Series.Name, y = IMDB.Ranking))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

Add title, labels using `title()`, `xlab()` and `ylab()`. **Please change the labels and title in your assignment**

```{r}
ggplot(episodes, aes(y = Series.Name, x = IMDB.Ranking))+ # Changed x and y order for horizontal
  geom_boxplot()+                                         # Add boxplot
  xlab("IMDB")+                                           # Add x-label
  ylab("Series")+                                         # Add y-label
  ggtitle("IMDB Ranking of Star Trek Series")+            # Add title
  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5))               # Adjust title to middle
```

Create pair of histograms for IMDB rankings of **Star Trek: The Next Generation** based on Bechdel-Wallace Test status. The `aes(y=..density..)` is used to display the density rather than count.

```{r}
filter(episodes,Series.Name=="The Next Generation")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=IMDB.Ranking))+
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), bins = 30)+
  facet_wrap(~Bechdel.Wallace.Test)
```

### Question 2

Find the total number of rows in the `episodes` table. The `<-` operator assigns the value of the right hand side to the variable on the left-hand side (can be named anything, not just `n`).

```{r}
n <- nrow(episodes)
n # To display the value of a variable, call it like this, or print(n)
```

Find the mean IMDB ranking. **`episodes$IMDB.Ranking` selects the `IMDB.Ranking` column from the `episodes` dataframe.**

```{r}
mean <- mean(episodes$IMDB.Ranking)
mean
```

Find the sum of squared distances from the mean IMDB Ranking, with `mean` already found above. Equivalent to $$
\sum_{i=1}^n{(x_i-\bar{x})^2}
$$

```{r}
x <- episodes$IMDB.Ranking
sum_of_squared_distances <- sum((x - mean)^2)
sum_of_squared_distances
```

Display the histogram of the episode's IMDB rankings.

```{r}
episodes %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = IMDB.Ranking))+
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), bins = 30)
```

## Part 2: Computing Basic Probabilities for Events

### Question 1,2 & 3

*Basically counting things*

Find the number of episodes passing the Bechdel Wallace Test.

```{r}
pass_count <- sum(episodes$Bechdel.Wallace.Test == TRUE)
pass_count
```

The condition `episodes$Bechdel.Wallace.Test == TRUE` can be changed to any other condition, such as: Number of episodes from *Star Trek: The Original Series*.

```{r}
original_count <- sum(episodes$Series.Name == "The Original Series")
original_count
```

Or the number of episodes from *Star Trek: The Original Series* and pass the Bechdel-Wallace Test. You can apply multiple conditions using the `&` operator between the two comparisons.

```{r}
original_pass_count <- sum(episodes$Series.Name == "The Original Series" & 
                             episodes$Bechdel.Wallace.Test == TRUE)
original_pass_count
```

### Question 4

*More advanced counting by accounting for categorical data*

The number of episodes of each season for each series, that already passed the Bechdel Wallace Test. *Don't worry if the last two lines don't make sense.*

```{r}
episodes%>% 
  filter(Bechdel.Wallace.Test == TRUE)%>% # Remove this filter for all episodes
  group_by(Series.Name, Season)%>%
  tally()%>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Series.Name, values_from = n)%>%
  bind_rows(summarise_all(., ~sum(., na.rm=TRUE)))%>% # Total column
  mutate(Total = rowSums(.[setdiff(names(.),"Season")], na.rm = TRUE)) # Total row
```

## Part 3: Modelling with Probability Distributions

### Question 1 & 2

*In R, given any distribution (Binomial, Geometric, Poisson, Normal, etc.), the Probability Density Function* $Pr(X = x)$ can be found using `d<distribution name>`, and the cumulative probability can be found using `p<distribution name>`. I show the Geometric distribution as an example.

Given $X \sim Geom(0.5)$, find $Pr(X=2)$.

```{r}
dgeom(2, prob = 0.5)
```

Given $X \sim Geom(0.5)$, find $Pr(X \leq 2)$.

```{r}
pgeom(2, prob = 0.5)
```

For other distributions, please refer to the documentation [[here]](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Distributions.html), or a slightly more visually engaging example [[here]](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/100906_8e3a32dd11c14b839468db756cee7400.html).

### Question 3

Plot the probability distributions for the number of successes out of 10 trials, with a success probability of 0.5; using the Binomial $X_B \sim Binom(10,0.5)$ and Poisson $X_P \sim Pois(10\times0.5)$.

```{r}
n <- 10
p <- 0.5

number_of_successes <- 1:n

# Generate the dataframe with 3 columns: Successes, Binomial, Poisson
data <- data.frame(Successes = number_of_successes,
                   Binomial = dbinom(number_of_successes,n,p),
                   Poisson = dpois(number_of_successes,n*p))
# Plot side-by-side plots
data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -c(Successes), names_to = "Distribution") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Successes, y = value))+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=data$Successes)+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  facet_wrap(~Distribution)
```

## Extra

### Embed an image

Use `![](path\to\image)`. Replace the `path\to\image` with the actual path to your image. For example. I have a `QUT_Logo.jpg` in the same folder as my `R Markdown` file, which can be added using `![](QUT_Logo.jpg)`.
